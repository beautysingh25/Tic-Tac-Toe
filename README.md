# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns marking a cell with their symbol, either "X" or "O". The goal is to be the first to align three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. It's a classic game that encourages strategic thinking and is easy to learn, making it popular across all ages.
